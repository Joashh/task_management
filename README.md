# ChoreChamp

ChoreChamp is a task management application created as part of my examination for the **Software Developer position at VIPTutors**. Although I did not fully complete it, I put my **best effort, dedication, and hard work** into this project.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vue.js (Vanilla Vue, no frameworks like Nuxt)
- **Backend:** Laravel 12
- **Database:** MySQL (managed via MySQL Workbench)
- **Authentication:** Session-based cookies (CSRF & XSS protection included)
- **Routing:** Frontend route guards to prevent unauthorized access

---

## Features

### Task Management
- **Drag & Drop:** Tasks can be reordered, and changes are saved in the database.
- **Task Status:** The top color indicates completion status.
- **Urgency Indicator:** Tasks are starred with colors representing urgency:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Low  
  - ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
  - ðŸ”´ High
- **Task Modal:** Click a task to open a modal with a brief view. Tasks can be marked as complete within the modal.

### Filtering & Search
- Tasks can be **filtered** by status and urgency.
- **Search bar** allows direct query for tasks.

---

## Database
- All tables are created via **Laravel migration files**, so the database can be recreated without manually modifying MySQL Workbench.
